    Anapanahalli Maha Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth and prosperity, both material and spiritual. Worshipped as ancestral home godess by several hindus from ancient times especially from Kunchitigas of Eradukere kula. Temple is located at Anapanahalli near Honnudike, Tumkur district, Karnataka.
A special worship is also offered to Lakshmi on the auspicious Varalakshmi vratha festival and on Deepavali night
It is believed that worshipping Anapanahalli Maha Lakshmi on Vara-Lakshmi vratha festival is equivalent to worshipping Ashtalakshmi i.e. the eight Goddesses of Wealth (Sri), Earth (Bhu), Learning (Saraswati), Love (Priti), Fame (Kirti), Peace (Shanti), Pleasure (Tushti) and Strength (Pushti)
On the full moon night following Dasara or Durga Puja, Hindus worship Lakshmi ceremonially at home, pray for her blessings and invite neighbors to attend the puja. It is believed that on this full moon night the goddess herself visits the homes and replenishes the inhabitants with wealth
